# CryptoZombiesT2
Example documentation of the SecurEth Guidelines Process using the CryptoZombies Lessons code

This repository takes the [guidelines](https://guidelines.secureth.org/) and uses the process to 
document the code described in the [CryptoZombies website](https://cryptozombies.io).  The repository has the 
documented code (with requirements), the supporting documents (SDD, Dev Plan, Architecture docs) and it includes 
JavaScript tests for each lesson.  Each lesson compiles and the tests run

Please enjoy and let us know about any comments on the [guidelines](https://guidelines.secureth.org/) website.
